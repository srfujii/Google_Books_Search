## Description

  This MERN full-stack application uses MongoDB as its database, Express as its server-side web framework, React as its front-end client-side framework, and Node.js as its back-end javascript web server platform. This Google Books search app allows you to search any book via title or author from the Google Books API, and find any books that meet your criteria. You can then save these books, view your "personal library" (your saved books), see more detailed information about any book, or delete books from your reading list (your saved books).

  This web application is **accessible** to users who will view it both on larger computer screens and also on smaller screen sizes, and the code is **up to current industry standards** and **uses best known practices**.
